Emmisions by Fuel and Data Type
This included 2 data sources

Database Type:
Relational Database because we want to join on facility id

Findings:
We are able to look at 2021 emissions by emissions types and fuel sources for future analysis. 
We can utilize this data to compare cities and states emissions data. 

See Jupyter notebook for a clear explanation of the ETL process within the comments.
